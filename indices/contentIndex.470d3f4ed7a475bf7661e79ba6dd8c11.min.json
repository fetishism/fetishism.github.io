Tekton组件及资源对象\n\nTekton由如下7个组件构成\n\n1）Tekton Pipeline：Tekton Pipeline是Tekton的基础组件，定义了一组Kubernetes自定义资源。作为构建模块的基础，你可以使用它们装配CI/CD流水线。\n\n2）Tekton Trigger：Tekton Trigger可以实现基于事件实例化的流水线。例如，你可以在GitHub代码库合并PR时触发流水线的实例化和执行，也可以创建一个用于启动特定的Tekton触发器的用户接口。\n\n3）Tekton CLI：Tekton CLI提供了一个名为tkn的命令行界面，你可以使用它与Tekton进行交互。\n\n4）Tekton Dashboard：Tekton Dashboard是Tekton Pipeline的Web图形界面，展示有关流水线的执行状况。\n\n5）Tekton Catalog：Tekton Catalog是一个高质量的、由社区贡献的构建模块（任务、流水线等）仓库。这些模块可随时在你的流水线中使用，例如docker-build、create-gitlab-release、git-clone等共用的构建模块。如果我们在Tekton中需要实现docker-build功能，无须自己编写Task，可直接使用Catalog项目中提供的功能配置，也可以根据自己的需求进行修改。\n\n6）Tekton Hub：Tekton Hub是用于访问Tekton Catalog的Web图形界面。\n\n7）Tekton Operator：Tekton Operator是一个Kubernetes Operator，可用于便捷地在Kubernetes集群上安装、更新以及删除Tekton项目。\n\nTekton引入了Task、Pipeline、TaskRun、PipelineRun、PipelineResource概念，通过它们指定任何想要运行的工作负载。\n\n1）Task：定义了一个由Step组成的有序集合，每个步骤基于一组特定的输入调用特定的构建工具，并产生一组特定的输出。\n\n2）Pipeline：定义了一系列与构建或交付相关的Task，可由事件触发或PipelineRun调用。\n\n3）TaskRun：通过特定的输入、输出、执行参数来实例化Task。换句话说，Task告诉了Tekton该做什么，而TaskRun则告诉Tekton在什么参数基础上做。\n\n4）PipelineRun：实例化特定的Pipeline，在一组特定输入的基础上执行Pipeline并产生一组特定的输出到特定目标。\n\n5）PipelineResource：用于定义Task中Step的输入和输出的位置。\n\n每个任务都在自己的Kubernetes Pod中执行。因此，默认情况下，流水线中的任务不共享数据。要想在任务之间共享数据，你必须显式配置每个任务，以使其输出可用于下一个任务，并将先前执行的任务的输出作为其输入。任何一个任务都适用此规则。\n\nTask与Pipeline的适用场景如下。\n\n1）Task适用于简单的工作负载，诸如运行测试、代码检查或构建Kaniko缓存。每个Task在独立的Kubernetes Pod中执行，使用独立的存储空间。Task在定义简单任务的同时保持配置上的简单。\n\n2）Pipeline适用于复杂的工作负载，诸如对代码的静态分析、测试、构建、部署这类需要完成多个任务的综合项目。","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T12:55:23.615060578Z","tags":null},"/devops/tekton/introducton/concept":{"title":"","content":"\n# Tekton的概念模型\n\nTekton的主要功能是实现持续集成和交付部署。Tekton Pipeline是其核心组件，其他组件都是建立在Tekton Pipeline之上的。\n\n## Step、Task和Pipeline\n\nStep（步骤）是CI/CD工作流中最小的基础操作单元。Tekton通过在Step中定义的容器镜像执行每个Step。它可以实现各种需求，如编译代码后制作成镜像并推送到镜像仓库，再把相应的程序镜像发布到Kubernetes集群中，这些实施细节都需要在Step中定义。\n\nTask（任务）是由Step组成的集合。Tekton中会以Kubernetes Pod的形式运行Task，而Task中的每个Step都将作为Kubernetes集群Pod中的一个容器运行。此种设计模式允许同一个Task中的众多Step共享相应的资源，例如，Pod中的各容器可以访问在Pod级别定义的存储卷。\n\nPipeline（流水线）是Task的集合，可以按特定的执行顺序定义Task。每个Task都将作为Kubernetes集群上的一个Pod运行。为了使各Task共同协作实现持续集成，Pipeline提供了如任务重试、排序控制等功能。\n\n如下所示，Pipeline中引用了Task A、Task B、Task C、Task D，因为Pipeline中各Task默认为并发执行，无法满足后一个Task依赖前一个Task结果的需求，所以使用排序功能定义各Task的执行顺序。首先由Task A运行，当Task A运行结束后，Task B和Task C并发运行。待Task B和Task C运行结束后Task D运行。我们还可以观察到，每个Task中的Step都是按定义的顺序在执行。如果想调整Task中Step的运行顺序，只能在Task中重新对Step进行排序。\n\n![task](/devops/tekton/images/task.png)\n\n## 2 输入与输出资源\n\n每个Task和Pipeline可能都有自己的输入和输出，在Tekton中称为输入和输出资源。例如，定义一个Task，此Task主要完成代码从编译到镜像的创建，这时可以将Git存储库作为输入，容器镜像作为输出。如下所示，该任务从存储库克隆源代码，然后运行一些测试，最后将源代码构建为可执行的容器镜像。\n\n![in-output](/devops/tekton/images/in-output.png)\n\nTekton支持多种不同类型的资源，以下列出主要的资源类型。\n\n·Git：Git存储库。\n\n·Pull Request：Git存储库中的特定请求。\n\n·Image：容器镜像。\n\n·Cluster：为Tekton所在集群以外的Kubernetes集群提供访问。\n\n·Storage：Blob存储中的对象或目录，例如Google云存储。\n\n·CloudEvent：定义事件数据的规范。\n\n## 3 TaskRun与PipelineRun\n\nTaskRun可以在集群上实例化和执行Task。在Pipeline之外通过单独运行TaskRun来执行Task，并且通过TaskRun查看Task中每个Step执行的细节。PipelineRun可以在集群上实例化和执行Pipeline。通过PipelineRun的运行状态查看每个Task的详细信息和运行情况。\n\nTaskRun和PipelineRun把资源与Task和Pipeline对象串联起来，通过运行TaskRun和PipelineRun来完成一次CI/CD的工作流。\n\n创建TaskRun和PipelineRun有多种方式，可以通过手动创建、在Dashboard上创建或通过触发器触发自动创建等方式完成，如下所示。\n\n![in-output](/devops/tekton/images/pipeline.png)\n\n## 4 Tekton的运作方式\n\n总体来说，Tekton Pipeline的核心功能是打包每个步骤。其中，Tekton Pipeline会在Step容器中注入一个二进制文件，将其作为入口点。当系统准备就绪时，将执行指定的命令。\n\nTekton Pipeline使用Kubernetes注释来跟踪Pipeline的状态。这些注释通过Kubernetes Downward API以文件的形式投射到每个Step容器中。该入口点的二进制文件密切关注投射的文件，只有在特定注释显示为文件时才会启动命令。例如，当要求Tekton在一个Task中连续运行两个Step时，注入第二个Step容器中的入口点的二进制文件将闲置等待，直到注释报告第一个Step容器成功完成。\n\n此外，Tekton Pipeline会安排一些容器在Step容器之前和之后自动运行，以支持特定的内置功能，例如检索输入资源和将输出加载到存储库。你也可以通过TaskRun和PipelineRun跟踪它们的运行状态。在运行Step容器之前，系统还会执行许多其他操作来设置环境。\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T12:55:23.615060578Z","tags":null},"/devops/tekton/introducton/getting_starte":{"title":"","content":"\n# Tekton应用CI/CD配置\n\n下面的Pipeline配置中使用了镜像标签自动生成、代码构建和镜像推送、应用镜像部署三个任务。也可以根据各自持续集成和交付的需求添加诸如代码质量检查、自动化测试等任务，不断完善持续集成和交付系统。\n\n## Java语言配置示例\n\n通过Maven工具构建Java代码。为了提高构建效率，需要为Maven本地仓库配置持久存储，否则会导致每次运行Maven都需要远程下载依赖包。\n\n在Tekton的最佳实践中，鼓励对Task的重用，这样可以减少维护功能重复的Task。下面的镜像标签自动生成与应用镜像部署任务可以在其他Pipeline中重用。\n\n基于Java代码的CI/CD配置示例如下：\n\n```yml\n#

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `config.yaml`. An example, with descriptions for each setting, can be found [here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/config.yaml).\n\n### Code Block Titles\n\nTo add code block titles with Amethyst:\n\n1. Ensure that code block titles are enabled in the configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\n\nIf you would like to customize the favicons, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Amethyst's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\n\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`. The default configuration, with descriptions, can be found [here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/data/graphConfig.yaml).\n\n### Language Support\n\n[Chinese, Japanese, and Korean support](features/language.md) comes out of the box with Amethyst.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Amethyst) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.yaml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\ndefaultContentLanguage: ar\nlanguages:\n  ar:\n    languagedirection: rtl\n    title: مدونتي\n    weight: 2\n```\n\n# Custom Styles\n\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling in `assets/_custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Changing the Color Scheme\nThe default color schemes for light mode and dark mode are located in `assets/_colors.scss`. You can replace the values for existing color variables for drop-in edits, or create new variables to reference in `_custom.scss`.\n\n### Changing the Fonts\nAll fonts are defined in `assets/_fonts.scss`. There are examples for both local fonts (defined using `@font-face`) and webfonts (fetched with `@import` from a font distributor such as Google Fonts).\n\nYou can place all local fonts in the `static/fonts` folder.\n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

If you are using a `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1.

You can organize content into any subfolder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `setup/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](setup/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/setup/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/setup/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

If you forked and cloned Amethyst directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](/setup/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/setup/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Amethyst is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Amethyst folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-amethyst\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `main` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `deploy` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to use a subdomain? That's easy too.\n\n\u003e Don't want to use GitHub Pages? Continue following the instructions below, and simply point your hosting solution to serve the `deploy` branch with no additional build steps required.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.yaml` here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/config.yaml)\n\n```yaml\nbaseURL: \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/amethyst/`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```yaml\nbaseURL: \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/amethyst/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /amethyst` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: deploy\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `amethyst.bencuan.me`, put `https://amethyst.bencuan.me/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Amethyst project:\n\n📁 [Amethyst Repository](https://github.com/64bitpandas/amethyst)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Amethyst.\n\n### Does Amethyst have Latex support?\n\nYes! See [LaTeX](features/latex.md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Amethyst?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Amethyst.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from the `deploy` branch (and not `main`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/setup/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Amethyst by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root folder (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Amethyst makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](setup/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](setup/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](setup/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](setup/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](setup/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](setup/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/setup/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/setup/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Amethyst needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](setup/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Amethyst is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nAmethyst isn't perfect!
